<h1>My portfolio</h1>

<p>This is my own portfolio, which contains all the information relevant to a professional who wants to enter the job market, such as personal information, skills, projects and contacts. In this project, I wanted to detail very well my experiences up to this point in my studies and described each of the stacks with which I study and practice in my daily life. It also contains some of my personal projects, made for study purposes and my professional CV to be analyzed by anyone who so wishes.</p>
